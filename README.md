# Ethereum Blockexplorer with Next.js, Typescript and Tailwind CSS
This is the Alchemy Ethereum Developer Bootcamp Week 3 project.  
The starter code and assignment are available [here](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/blockexplorer).  
I migrated it to [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

Most prominent technologies used:
* [Alchemy SDK](https://docs.alchemy.com/)
* [React](https://react.dev/)
* [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
* [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
* [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
* [Headless UI](https://headlessui.com/)

## Running the project locally
* Clone this repo, and cd into it in your terminal:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/davidde/ethblox
  cd ethblox
  ```
* First, install the project's packages:
  ```bash
  npm install
  # or
  yarn install
  # or
  pnpm install
  # or
  bun install
  ```
* Then, start the development server:
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  # or
  yarn dev
  # or
  pnpm dev
  # or
  bun dev
  ```
  This will start the Next.js development server on port 3005 (set in `package.json > scripts > dev`), so open http://localhost:3005 in the browser to see the result.
