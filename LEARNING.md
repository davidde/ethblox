# Notes while building / learning
## Security
* After checking out [Key security Best practices](https://docs.alchemy.com/docs/best-practices-for-key-security-and-management) and [Using JWTs](https://docs.alchemy.com/docs/how-to-use-jwts-for-api-requests), it is not clear to me how one would go about updating the JWTs, since they are supposed to be short-lived. In the example, their expiration time is even 10 minutes! How to keep the service functioning if JWTs are expiring that fast?

## Alchemy SDK
* Is it possible to use other API providers than Alchemy itself, like it is with ethers.js? (E.g. Infura, Etherscan, Cloudfare, etc.)
